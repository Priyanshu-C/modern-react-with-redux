## ðŸ’» Course

This course changed how I think about and process code. I have always wanted to try building my own web application and this has given me the confidence to do so! Stephen really goes into great detail to help you gain a deep understanding of challenging concepts while keeping things fresh. I highly recommend this course to anyone. The most dificult part was the redux one for sure,i've watched it at least 3 times but in the end when you finally get it it really makes you feel like you can build anything.
